## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **arc-compacting** skill: Strategic manual compaction timing at workflow phase boundaries
- **arc-evaluating** skill: Measure whether skills, agents, or workflows change AI agent behavior — with progressive-loading references (`cli-and-metrics.md`, `common-mistakes-catalog.md`, `grading-and-execution.md`)
- **arc-looping** skill: Autonomous loop execution with cross-session DAG task coordination
- **arc-managing-sessions** skill: Session save/resume with alias support and cooperative auto-memory coexistence
- **arc-researching** skill: Autonomous hypothesis-driven experimentation for metric optimization ("fixed judge + free player" pattern)
- 9 scoped rule files in `.claude/rules/` — extracted from monolithic CLAUDE.md for context-aware loading: architecture, coding-standards, git-workflow, hooks, plugin, security, skills, templates-commands-agents, testing
- 9 new agent definitions in `agents/`: debugger, eval-comparator, eval-grader, implementer, loop-operator, planner, quality-reviewer, spec-reviewer, verifier
- `AGENTS.md`: Agent catalog for Codex platform discovery
- Eval infrastructure: per-assertion code grading engine (`eval-graders.js`), statistics aggregation (`eval-stats.js`), core eval engine (`eval.js`), transcript parser (`transcript.js`)
- Eval dashboard: `eval-dashboard.js` + `eval-dashboard-ui.html` — web UI with collapsible artifacts panel and audit trail
- Eval scenarios: 11 new scenarios (debug-investigate-first, debug-stop-at-three, diary-quality, eval-grader-selection, eval-scenario-splitting, eval-trap-design, hook-inject-skills, instinct-adherence, reflect-pattern-detection, tdd-compliance) + eval skill-files for instinct testing
- Eval benchmarks: JSON snapshots for 2026-03-19, 2026-03-20, 2026-03-23
- Research dashboard: `research-dashboard.js` + `research-dashboard.html` — live monitoring with SSE and inline SVG charts

- Session management: `session-aliases.js` for alias-based session tracking, `session-utils.js` expanded with new helpers
- `commands/sessions.md`: Thin delegation wrapper for session management
- `docs/guide/hooks-system.md`: Comprehensive hooks I/O visibility rules and contributor guide
- `hooks/log_lightweight/`: Refactored Python logging into 6-module package (config, dispatcher, io_writer, state, tokens, tools)

- `arc-writing-skills/agents/`: 4 eval subagent definitions (description-tester, skill-analyzer, skill-comparator, skill-grader) + `references/eval-schemas.md` and `testing-skills-with-subagents.md`
- Tests: `e2e-hooks.test.js` (36 behavioral tests with real Claude Code fixtures), `observe.test.js`, `pre-compact.test.js`, `quality-check.test.js`, `coordinator.test.js`, `eval-dashboard.test.js`, `eval-integration.test.js`, `eval-stats.test.js`, `eval.test.js`, `locking.test.js`, `loop.test.js`, `package-manager.test.js`, `research-dashboard.test.js`, `session-aliases.test.js`, `session-listing.test.js`, `transcript.test.js`, `utils.test.js`, `test-models.js`, `test-yaml-parser.js`, `test_eval_agents_contract.py`, `test_eval_scenario_format.py`, `test_skill_arc_evaluating.py`

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md`: Slimmed from 69 to 28 lines — bulk content extracted to `.claude/rules/` for scoped loading
- `arc-evaluating/SKILL.md`: 8 targeted improvements from research loop — restructured for token budget with progressive-loading references; added "competence proxy" and "skill formalizes existing behavior" to Common Mistakes
- `arc-agent-driven/SKILL.md`: Enhanced with eval-aware subagent dispatching
- `arc-writing-skills/SKILL.md`: Updated to reference new eval agents and testing-with-subagents guide
- `arc-brainstorming/SKILL.md`, `arc-observing/SKILL.md`, `arc-planning/SKILL.md`, `arc-refining/SKILL.md`, `arc-using/SKILL.md`: Minor refinements (cross-references, SKILL_ROOT, eval hooks)
- Hooks output visibility: user-facing messages switched from stderr (invisible in Claude Code) to `systemMessage` JSON format across observe, pre-compact, quality-check, and compact-suggester hooks
- `hooks/compact-suggester/main.js`: Refactored to unified `{ tools, reads, writes }` JSON state; separated compact counter from diary counter
- `hooks/session-tracker/inject-context.js`: Major refactoring for session alias support and cooperative auto-memory
- `hooks/session-tracker/end.js`: Enhanced session finalization with alias tracking
- `hooks/log-lightweight.py`: Refactored from monolithic 887-line file into 6-module package under `hooks/log_lightweight/`
- `scripts/cli.js`: Added `arc eval dashboard`, `arc research dashboard`, loop commands, and session management subcommands
- `scripts/lib/coordinator.js`: Enhanced DAG coordination with new status helpers
- `scripts/lib/models.js`: Added TaskStatus export from dag-schema
- `scripts/lib/dag-schema.js`: Added TaskStatus enum export
- `scripts/lib/utils.js`: Added new utility functions for eval and session support
- `README.md`: Updated skill descriptions and documentation links
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Updated hook architecture section

### Fixed

- **Hook stdin crash**: `log-lightweight` dispatcher crashed on empty stdin — now handles gracefully
- **Hook field name**: SessionStart event sends `source` field, not `trigger` — fixed across all hooks that read session start reason
- **Hook output invisible**: stderr output not visible to users in Claude Code — switched to `systemMessage` JSON protocol
- **Counter collision**: compact-suggester and diary hooks shared a counter, causing incorrect compaction timing — separated into independent counters
- `hooks/compact-suggester/README.md`: Corrected storage path documentation (`arcforge-tool-count` → `arcforge-compact-state`)
- `skills/arc-managing-sessions/SKILL.md`: Fixed command name references (`/sessions` → `/arc-managing-sessions`)
- `skills/arc-journaling/SKILL.md`: Fixed cross-reference to session commands

### Removed

- `.serena/memories/`: 4 legacy memory files (code_style_and_conventions, project_overview, suggested_commands, task_completion_checklist) — replaced by `.claude/rules/`
- `hooks/lib/package-manager.js`, `hooks/lib/thresholds.js`, `hooks/lib/utils.js`: Removed hook-local re-exports — hooks now import directly from `scripts/lib/`

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- `scripts/lib/evolve.js`: Three-type evolution engine — classifies instinct clusters into skills, commands, or agents via domain+confidence rules with keyword tiebreaker
- `learn.js generate` command: Creates skill, command, or agent scaffolds from clustered instincts (`--type`, `--name`, `--dry-run`)
- `learn.js list` command: Shows previously evolved artifacts from JSONL tracking log
- `session-utils.js`: `getEvolvedLogPath()` helper for `~/.claude/evolved/evolved.jsonl`
- Resistance-based confidence: `MANUAL_CONTRADICT_DELTA`, `MANUAL_DECAY_PER_WEEK`, `RESISTANT_SOURCES` for source-aware scoring
- Tests: `evolve.test.js` (358 lines), `confidence.test.js` additions (118 lines), `learn.test.js` (135 lines)

### Changed

- `confidence.js`: `applyContradiction()` accepts optional `source` — manual/reflection instincts receive half-strength contradiction (-0.05 vs -0.10)
- `confidence.js`: `runDecayCycle()` applies source-aware decay — resistant sources decay at 50% rate
- `instinct.js`: passes `frontmatter.source` to `applyContradiction()` for resistance-based scoring
- `learn.js`: Extracted helpers, removed duplication, derived constants from centralized modules

### Fixed

- `learn.js generate`: Refuses to overwrite existing artifacts — exits with error instead of silently clobbering
- `learn.js generate`: `--name` sanitized to prevent path traversal (`/`, `\`, `..`)
- `learn.js generate`: `--type` validated against allowed values (skill, command, agent)
- `learn.js generate`: Empty slug fallback uses domain name instead of broken paths
- `learn.js`: Evolution deduplication scoped to project to prevent cross-project false positives
